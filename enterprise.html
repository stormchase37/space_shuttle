  <p><img src="../images/enterprise.jpg" class="illusFloatLeft"width="265" height="169" alt="Space Shuttle Enterprise" />Space Shuttle Enterprise was built to test the approach and landing dynamics of the shuttle. Enterprise rolled out of the manufacturing facility in Palmdale, CA on September 17, 1976. The original name for Enterprise was Constitution because the shuttle was being rolled out on Constitution Day. What caused NASA to change the name from Constitution to Enterprise was that fans of Star Trek sent thousands of letters to President Gerald Ford. Space Shuttle Enterprise was built without engines and heat shield because it was never meant to go into space. This test shuttle gave astronauts a feel for how the shuttle would fly back to Earth during descent from space.</p>

<p><img src="../images/enterpriselaunch.jpg" class="illusFloatRight" width="268" height="171" alt="Space Shuttle Enterprise Launch Configuration" />Before doing the drop tests for testing how the shuttle would land, NASA did several taxi tests with Enterprise on top of a modified 747 also known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA)which would ferry the shuttle fleet between California and Florida if the shuttle lands at Edwards Air Force Base. Next they flew Enterprise ontop of the SCA without crew to test the aerodynamics of the SCA would change with the 100 ton shuttle on its back. After the drop tests were completed, NASA attached Enterprise to two solid rocket boosters and an external tank to test the launch configuration.</p>
